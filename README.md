--spellblade class
Core concept => a set of weapons that deal 125% damage but 75% magic and 50% melee so that players must
balance between armor sets that give bonuses to both melee and magic.

balance this by noting down all items and accesories that give bonuses to those two types of damages
	just spreadsheets I guess
how modifiers (prefixes) would work for them
	(should there be custom ones? between magic/summoning and melee should some be barred?)
deciding when the player should gain access to an item and how that would affect descicions of items of similar potency
	(see class setups for each class in vanilla, possibly in some of the more notable mods, e.g. thorium?)
	
--spellblade ideas

accesories or features that allow it so spell blade items are affected in some of the following manners
an X amount more blades summoned per cast
piercing?
homing?
